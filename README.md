# **Assesment_Test**

## Instructions


## In python:

1.	Create a class to standardize (subtract the mean and divide by standard deviation) an input pandas dataframe.
   - a.	Implement a fit method
    -b.	Implement a transform method
    -c.	Implement an inverse transform method
2.	Write a unit test for that class to make sure the class correctly standardizes a column of data, and then another unit test to make sure it correctly inverse transforms a column of standardized data.
3.	Write a function that preprocesses a given string:
    a.	Tokenize the text
    b.	Remove punctuation from the text
    c 	Remove stopwords from the text
    d.	Lemmatize the text
    e.	Return processed text
4.	Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns a list of processed strings.
5.	Write a unit test to make sure the function correctly preprocesses a given list of strings
